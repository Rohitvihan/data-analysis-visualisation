 Automobile Data Analysis

**Description:**
This project performs data analysis and visualization on a dataset of automobiles to explore various aspects of car features. It includes the following key visualizations:

1. **Distribution of Cars Based on Number of Doors and Fuel Type**:
   - A bar plot showing the distribution of cars with two or four doors, categorized by the fuel type (gas, diesel).

2. **Body Style Distribution by Fuel Type**:
   - A stacked bar chart visualizing the total number of cars for each body style (e.g., sedan, hatchback), with the breakdown of fuel types.

3. **Horsepower Distribution by Fuel Type and Drive Wheel Type**:
   - A box plot illustrating the distribution of horsepower for each fuel type (gas, diesel), broken down by drive wheel type (FWD, RWD, 4WD).

The project uses **Pandas** for data manipulation, **Seaborn** for statistical visualization, and **Matplotlib** for plotting.
