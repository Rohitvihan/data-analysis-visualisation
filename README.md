**Data Analysis and Visualization**

This project focuses on **data analysis** and **visualization** using **Python**, specifically with **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib**/ **Seaborn** for visualization. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset and present them visually for better understanding.

#### **Objective:**
The main objective of this analysis is to:
- Perform **data cleaning** to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends, patterns, and key relationships in the data.
- Visualize findings through various types of plots to help make the analysis more accessible.

#### **Key Data Visualizations:**
1. **Bar Charts**: Display the distribution of specific features (e.g., counts, totals) for easier comparison.
2. **Line Plots**: Show trends over time or across categories (e.g., changes over different periods or seasons).
3. **Pie Charts**: Represent the distribution of categorical data.
4. **Scatter Plots**: Visualize the relationship between two numeric variables to identify correlations.
5. **Heatmaps**: Represent correlation matrices to highlight relationships between variables.

#### **Data Preprocessing:**
- **Cleaning**: Missing data is handled, irrelevant columns are removed, and data is normalized if needed.
- **Transformation**: Grouping, merging, and reshaping the data to create useful aggregates.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new derived columns or metrics to enhance analysis.

#### **Key Insights:**
- Identification of important trends or outliers in the dataset.
- Visualization of key metrics for better understanding of the data.
- Relationships between different variables, including possible correlations.

#### **Libraries Used:**
- `Pandas`: For data loading, manipulation, and aggregation.
- `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`: For data visualization and graphical representation.

#### **File Structure:**
- **`data/`**: Contains raw datasets used for analysis.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks containing step-by-step analysis and visualizations.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for data processing and cleaning.
- **`output/`**: Folder for saved visualizations and results.
